# This file illustrates how to implement a processor, realizing the selection
# steps and outputting histograms and a cutflow with efficiencies.
# Here we create a very simplified version of the ttbar-to-dilep processor.
# One can run this processor using
# 'python3 -m pepper.runproc --debug example_processor.py example_config.json'
# Above command probably will need a little bit of time before all cuts are
# applied once. This is because a chunk of events are processed simultaneously.
# You change adjust the number of events in a chunk and thereby the memory
# usage by using the --chunksize parameter (the default value is 500000).
